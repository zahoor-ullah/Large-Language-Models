# Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced deep learning systems trained on massive text datasets to understand, generate, and reason with natural language. They power many modern AI applications, from chatbots and coding assistants to search engines and content generation tools.
This repository explores the concepts, implementations, and applications of LLMs, including:
Fundamentals of transformer-based architectures.
Training and fine-tuning techniques for domain-specific tasks.
Prompt engineering and best practices for effective use.
Integration of LLMs into real-world applications (e.g., chatbots, agents, APIs).
Hands-on projects to bridge theory and practice.
Whether youâ€™re a beginner learning the basics or an advanced developer experimenting with cutting-edge techniques, this repo serves as a resource for understanding and building with LLMs.
